Absolutely! This code defines a **Tool-Using AI Agent** using the LangChain framework. It’s designed to intelligently decide when to use external tools—like a web search—and when to rely on its own knowledge. Let’s break it down into digestible parts:

---

## 🧠 Purpose of the Agent

The agent follows a reasoning loop:
- **Analyze** the user’s question
- **Decide** whether it needs external data
- **Use tools** like DuckDuckGo search if needed
- **Respond** with a well-reasoned answer

This is ideal for tasks that require **real-time information**, like news, weather, or recent developments.

---

## 🔧 Key Components Explained

### 1. **Environment Setup**
```python
from dotenv import load_dotenv
load_dotenv()
```
Loads your `.env` file to securely access your OpenAI API key.

---

### 2. **Agent Initialization**
```python
self.llm = ChatOpenAI(...)
```
Creates a GPT-4-based language model with adjustable creativity (`temperature`).

```python
self.tools = [DuckDuckGoSearchRun(...)]
```
Defines the external tool: a web search function using DuckDuckGo.

```python
self.prompt = ChatPromptTemplate.from_messages([...])
```
Sets up the agent’s instructions. It teaches the agent:
- When to use tools
- How to explain its reasoning
- To avoid searching for basic facts

```python
self.agent = create_openai_functions_agent(...)
```
Wraps everything into a LangChain agent that can **call tools as needed**.

```python
self.agent_executor = AgentExecutor(...)
```
Runs the agent with limits (e.g., max 3 steps) and shows intermediate reasoning.

---

### 3. **Running the Agent**
```python
def run(self, user_input):
    result = self.agent_executor.invoke({"input": user_input})
```
This method:
- Accepts a user question
- Runs the agent
- Returns the final answer and any tools used

---

### 4. **Explaining Tools**
```python
def explain_tools(self):
    # Lists available tools and how the agent chooses them
```
Useful for debugging or teaching—shows what tools are available and how the agent thinks.

---

### 5. **Test Cases**
```python
test_cases = [...]
```
Three examples:
- A basic fact (should NOT use search)
- A current event (SHOULD use search)
- Real-time weather (SHOULD use search)

Each test runs the agent and prints:
- Final answer
- Whether tools were used
- What input was sent to the tool

---

## 🧩 Why This Is Powerful

This agent can:
- **Decide autonomously** when to use external tools
- **Explain its reasoning**
- **Combine tool results with its own knowledge**

It’s a step toward **autonomous, reasoning-capable AI systems**—not just chatbots.

---

 extend this agent with more tools (like calculators, APIs, or databases)? Or connect it to a UI or Slack bot? I can help you build that next layer.

 Great! If you want to **test whether your Tool-Using Agent is correctly invoking external tools like DuckDuckGoSearchRun**, you need prompts that require **real-time or recent information**—things the LLM wouldn’t know from its training data alone.

Here are some **effective prompt examples** to trigger tool usage:

---

### 🧪 Prompts That Should Trigger Web Search

1. **"What are the latest advancements in quantum computing as of September 2025?"**  
   → Forces the agent to search for recent breakthroughs or news.

2. **"Who won the UEFA Champions League in 2025?"**  
   → Requires current sports results.

3. **"What’s the weather like in Corbeil-Essonnes right now?"**  
   → Needs real-time weather data.

4. **"What are the top AI conferences happening in Europe this fall?"**  
   → Requires up-to-date event listings.

5. **"Give me the latest stock price of Microsoft."**  
   → Should trigger a financial data search.

6. **"What are people saying about the new iPhone released this month?"**  
   → Needs recent reviews or social buzz.

---

### 🧠 Prompts That Should *Not* Trigger Tool Use

These are useful for testing whether the agent avoids unnecessary tool calls:

- **"What is the capital of Japan?"**
- **"Explain how neural networks work."**
- **"What is Python used for?"**

These are basic knowledge questions that the LLM should answer directly.

---

Want to test how your agent reasons about tool usage? Try combining both types:

> “What is Python used for, and what are the most popular Python libraries in 2025?”

The first part should be answered from training data, the second might trigger a search.
